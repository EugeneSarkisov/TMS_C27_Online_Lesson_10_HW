task1
We created four classes (Card, CardFabric, Client, CardChecker). 
In classes Client and Card we set up patterns for Card and Client objects. 
In CardFabric class we made method to create Card arrays for Client objects. 
In CardChecker we created method "checkSameCards" with one parameter "Card[]" for counting same cards. 
Test-cases:
1. Delete all cards from CardFabric or create empty Card array and run;
2. Rename all cards and run;
3. Rename cvc and run;
4. Make 1/2/3/4 pair of cards and run.
